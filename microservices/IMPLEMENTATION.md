# Social Proof App - Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the current implementation status of the Social Proof App, a real-time social proof notification platform built with microservices architecture.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as a microservices architecture with the following components:

```
social-proof-app/
├── services/
│   ├── users/           # User management microservice
│   ├── notifications/   # Notification handling microservice
│   ├── analytics/       # Analytics and reporting microservice
│   ├── integrations/    # Third-party integrations microservice
│   ├── billing/         # Subscription and payment microservice
├── infrastructure/      # Infrastructure as code (Terraform, K8s)
├── shared/              # Shared libraries and utilities
├── docker-compose.yml   # Local development environment
└── README.md            # Project documentation
```

## Implemented Components

### Database Schemas

1. **Users Service**:

   - User management with PII encryption
   - Organizations and multi-tenancy
   - Team member management with RBAC
   - Invitation system
   - Audit logging
   - Row-Level Security (RLS) policies

2. **Notifications Service**:

   - Sites and tenant management
   - Notification templates
   - A/B testing capabilities
   - Channel-specific campaigns (web, email, push)
   - Targeting rules
   - Event tracking

3. **Analytics Service**:

   - TimescaleDB for time-series data
   - Continuous aggregates for performance
   - Funnel and cohort definitions
   - Report configurations
   - Archival tracking
   - Retention policies

4. **Integrations Service**:

   - Integration types and configuration
   - OAuth and API key management
   - Webhook handling (inbound and outbound)
   - Sync scheduling
   - Data mapping
   - Security features

5. **Billing Service**:
   - Plan definitions and features
   - Subscription management
   - Payment processing (Stripe integration)
   - Usage tracking and metering
   - Invoice generation

### API Routes and Services

1. **Users Service**:
   - Authentication (login, signup, password reset)
   - User profile management
   - Organization management
   - Team member management
   - Invitation system

### Infrastructure

1. **Docker Compose**:

   - Local development environment with:
     - PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB
     - Redis for caching
     - ClickHouse for analytics
     - Kafka and Zookeeper for messaging
     - Monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, Loki)

2. **Terraform**:
   - AWS infrastructure provisioning
   - EKS cluster configuration
   - Database setup (RDS, ElastiCache, MSK)
   - Networking and security

### DevOps

1. **Docker**:
   - Multi-stage builds for services
   - Optimized for development and production
   - Health checks and proper signal handling

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Implementation**:

   - Finish implementing all service APIs
   - Implement event sourcing with Kafka
   - Add real-time notification delivery

2. **Frontend Implementation**:

   - Develop admin dashboard with Next.js 14
   - Create notification builder UI
   - Implement real-time analytics visualization

3. **Testing**:

   - Add unit and integration tests
   - Set up end-to-end testing

4. **Deployment**:
   - Complete Kubernetes configurations
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines
   - Configure production environment

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, TypeScript, Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, ClickHouse
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Messaging**: Apache Kafka, Redis Streams
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform
- **Monitoring**: OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, Loki

## Current Status

This implementation focuses on establishing the core architecture and database schemas for the microservices. The basic API routes, service layers, and infrastructure components have been set up to demonstrate the overall design and approach.

The project is ready for further development to complete all services and add the frontend implementation for a complete social proof notification platform.
