## 🎯 MVP Capabilities

### Ready-to-Use Features

1. __Complete Development Environment__:
   * All services containerized and orchestrated
   * Database schemas initialized with sample data
   * External services mocked for safe development

2. __Real-Time Event Processing__:
   * Kafka message streaming configured
   * Event ingestion and processing pipeline
   * Analytics data collection and storage

3. __Database Architecture__:
   * Time-series data optimized with TimescaleDB
   * High-performance analytics with ClickHouse
   * Proper indexing and retention policies

4. __Testing Infrastructure__:
   * Automated health checks
   * End-to-end flow validation
   * Mock external service testing

5. __Monitoring & Debugging__:

### 🚀 Startup Process

The MVP can be started with a single command:

```bash
./scripts/start-mvp.sh
```

This will:

1. ✅ Start infrastructure services (Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse)
2. ✅ Wait for services to be ready with health checks
3. ✅ Initialize databases with schema and sample data
4. ✅ Create Kafka topics for event streaming
5. ✅ Start external service mocks
6. ✅ Start all microservices
7. ✅ Start Next.js application
8. ✅ Validate all services are operational

### 🧪 Testing & Validation

Complete test suite validates:

* ✅ Infrastructure service connectivity
* ✅ Database schema correctness
* ✅ Sample data presence
* ✅ Kafka topic configuration
* ✅ ClickHouse analytics setup
* ✅ External service mock functionality
* ✅ Container health and networking
* ✅ End-to-end event flow simulation
