# App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

A new user lands on the Fomo Clone platform landing page where they can read about the social-proof notification features and pricing tiers. From this page they can click Sign Up to begin. The Sign Up page offers two methods: entering an email address and password to create a new account, or using single sign-on via SAML or OIDC if their organization has been preconfigured for enterprise access. After submitting an email and password, the user receives a verification email with a link. Clicking that link takes them back to the app where they are prompted to complete their profile by selecting a default language, time zone, and organization name if it is their first sign up. If the user forgets their password, they can click the Forgot Password link on the Sign In form, provide their registered email address, and receive a reset link. That link opens a Reset Password page where they set a new password, and then are automatically signed in.

After creating or joining an organization, the user lands on the Main Dashboard. Signing out is available from the account menu in the top right corner on every page. Once signed out, the user returns to the landing page and may sign back in using their original credentials or SSO link. Throughout the app, any session expiration or invalid token triggers an automatic redirect to the Sign In page with a message explaining that the session has expired.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Upon successful login, the user sees the Main Dashboard. At the top is a global header displaying the organization name, a site selector dropdown showing all verified sites, and the user avatar with access to account settings and sign-out. Below the header is a row of live metric widgets for total impressions, clicks, conversions, and revenue in real time. Along the left side is a vertical navigation menu with sections labeled Dashboard, Sites, Notifications, Analytics, Integrations, Team, Billing, and Settings. The Dashboard view itself displays an overview chart of recent notification performance, a summary of active campaigns, and a quick action button to create a new notification or add a site.

The site selector dropdown allows switching between different merchant websites. Changing the site updates all displayed metrics and menus contextually, so that when the user navigates to Notifications or Analytics, they always see data and configuration relevant to the selected site. The quick navigation ensures users can move from the Dashboard to any other section in one click.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

When the user clicks Sites, they arrive on the Site Management page. Here they see a list of existing sites in a table. A button labeled Add Site opens a form where they enter the site name and URL. After submission the system prompts them to verify ownership. They can choose the DNS TXT record method by copying a provided token and adding it to their domain’s DNS settings, or follow an automated DNS CNAME wizard that guides them through adding the necessary records. Once verification succeeds, the page updates to show a code snippet to embed in the site’s head tag. The user copies the snippet and pastes it into their site to enable live notifications.

Clicking Notifications opens the Notification Builder landing page, which lists existing campaigns and experiments. A Create Notification button launches a wizard. The first step asks the user to choose a prebuilt template or upload a fully custom CSS/theme file. Next they define dynamic variables such as visitor name, location, and product details. In the following step they configure targeting rules using a visual boolean editor where they can specify geography, UTM parameters, or browsing behavior. The wizard then moves to variant management where the user adds two or more variants for A/B testing, names each variant, and customizes content or style independently. They decide on automatic winner selection at a defined significance threshold or choose to pick the winner manually later. The next step prompts them to select delivery channels: web pop-ups with service-worker caching, email campaigns via SendGrid, or browser push notifications via Firebase. For email and push they configure segmentation and scheduling, or let the AI-driven send-time optimization pick the ideal send window. After reviewing all settings on a summary screen, they click Publish. The app then shows a success notification and provides a shortcut back to the Dashboard or directly to the Analytics page for that campaign.

In the Integrations section, users see a list of native connectors. Clicking the Shopify connector reveals an enable flow where the user logs into their Shopify store and grants required permissions. A similar flow exists for WooCommerce and Zapier. For custom pipelines, users navigate to the Webhooks tab, copy their site’s webhook URL with built-in HMAC signing, and paste it into any external system. They may also configure retry policies and exponential back-off directly in the UI.

When the user opens Analytics, they view real-time charts of impressions, clicks, conversions, and revenue over selectable time ranges. Tabs within Analytics include Funnel Analysis, Cohorts, and Multi-Touch Attribution. Each tab lets the user zoom in on data, filter by variant or channel, and then click Export to generate a CSV or PDF download instantly or schedule a recurring email digest. The Export button opens a dialog to choose format, set filters, and define a schedule.

Team management begins with clicking Team in the sidebar. Admins see a list of invited members with pending and active statuses. To invite a teammate, they enter an email and assign a role: Admin, Analyst, or Designer. Invitations send an email with a unique link. Invitees click the link, sign up if needed, and their membership appears as active under the correct organization and site. Role changes and removals happen on this same page and take effect immediately.

In Billing, the user sees their current plan, usage metrics such as notifications sent this month, and allowed quotas. They may click Change Plan to open a page listing the five tiers: Free for Shopify, Starter, Business, Pro, and Unlimited. Choosing a new plan updates their subscription in Stripe, and the page displays confirmation and prorated charges. If they exceed plan quotas, a banner appears prompting an upgrade or notifying of overage charges. Trial extensions can be requested here as well.

Advanced enterprise users can access the White-Label tab under Settings. They may choose automatic DNS/CNAME setup by following a wizard similar to site verification, or copy manual instructions to configure their custom domain. They upload brand colors, fonts, animations, and optionally provide fully custom CSS/theme files. Upon saving, the embed snippet URL updates to reflect the white-labeled domain.

## Settings and Account Management

The Settings area allows each user to update personal information such as name, email address, and password. If the account uses multi-factor authentication, they can configure an authenticator app or SMS backup codes. Under Preferences, they choose their default locale and time zone, toggle email notifications for digests or system alerts, and switch UI language. Under Organization Settings, Admins configure audit log retention, enabling up to seven years of immutable records for GDPR and CCPA compliance. They also set raw event retention policies, choosing 90 days before automatic archival to S3 Glacier. After making any changes, a Save button returns them to the main Dashboard, where the updated settings take immediate effect.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

If a user enters an invalid email or password on Sign In, the form displays an inline error message explaining the issue. During password reset, using an expired or malformed token shows a clear message with a link to request a new reset. If network connectivity is lost while working in the wizard, a banner appears at the top with a Retry button and the current form data remains intact so the user can continue once connectivity returns. Domain verification failures show specific DNS errors and step-by-step guidance on resolving them. During campaign publishing, if the system cannot reach SendGrid or Firebase, the user sees an error indicating which channel failed and may choose to retry just that channel or publish only the other channels. In the Analytics page, if a query times out or data fails to load, a refresh icon appears with a message instructing the user to retry or contact support. Attempting a restricted action, such as an Analyst inviting new members, results in a clear access denied page explaining the lack of permissions. All error messages guide the user to the next corrective step.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From the moment a merchant discovers the Fomo Clone landing page to everyday use, the journey is clear and connected. A new user signs up or joins via invitation, verifies a site in minutes, and pastes an embed snippet. They create engaging notifications through a step-by-step builder that supports multi-variant experiments, AI-driven scheduling, and multiple channels. They monitor real-time analytics and export reports, invite team members on an invitation-only basis, and manage billing or enterprise branding as needed. Error states are handled gracefully at each step, ensuring the user never feels lost. Over time merchants iterate on campaigns, upgrade plans, and expand usage across sites, all within the same unified, secure, and scalable platform.
