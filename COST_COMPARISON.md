# Cost Comparison: Enterprise vs. MVP Infrastructure

This document compares the costs and resource requirements of the enterprise-grade infrastructure versus the simplified MVP deployment for fewer than 100 users.

## Enterprise Infrastructure Costs (Monthly)

| Service           | Instance Type   | Count  | Cost/Month    |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ------ | ------------- |
| EKS Cluster       | -               | 1      | $73           |
| EC2 Nodes         | t3.medium       | 2-5    | $67-$167      |
| RDS PostgreSQL    | db.t3.medium    | 1      | $80           |
| ElastiCache Redis | cache.t3.medium | 2      | $106          |
| MSK (Kafka)       | kafka.m5.large  | 3      | $216          |
| ClickHouse        | m5.xlarge       | 1      | $138          |
| S3 Storage        | -               | ~100GB | $3            |
| Network Traffic   | -               | -      | $30-50        |
| **TOTAL**         |                 |        | **$713-$833** |

## MVP Infrastructure Costs (Monthly)

| Service         | Instance Type | Count | Cost/Month  |
| --------------- | ------------- | ----- | ----------- |
| EC2             | t3.small      | 1     | $17         |
| Storage         | EBS           | 20GB  | $2          |
| Elastic IP      | -             | 1     | $3          |
| Network Traffic | -             | -     | $2-5        |
| **TOTAL**       |               |       | **$24-$27** |

## Cost Savings

The MVP infrastructure represents a **96% reduction** in monthly costs compared to the enterprise-grade setup.

## Resource Comparison

| Resource       | Enterprise    | MVP           | Reduction |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| CPU Cores      | 24-48         | 2             | 92-96%    |
| Memory         | 96-192GB      | 2GB           | 98-99%    |
| Database       | Dedicated RDS | Containerized | -         |
| Message Broker | Kafka Cluster | Redis         | -         |
| Analytics DB   | ClickHouse    | None          | 100%      |

## Performance Comparison

For fewer than 100 users, the MVP setup should provide:

- Sufficient CPU/memory for all services
- Database response times under 50ms for most queries
- API response times under 200ms
- Ability to handle 10-20 concurrent users
- Support for several hundred events per minute

## Scaling Thresholds

Consider upgrading components in this order as your user base grows:

1. **100-500 users**: Upgrade EC2 to t3.medium or t3.large
2. **500-1000 users**: Move database to a dedicated RDS instance
3. **1000-5000 users**: Separate frontend and backend to different instances
4. **5000+ users**: Migrate to a container orchestration solution

## Conclusion

The MVP infrastructure provides all the necessary functionality at a fraction of the cost. By focusing on essential components and right-sizing for your current user load, you can validate your product and grow your user base before committing to more expensive infrastructure.
