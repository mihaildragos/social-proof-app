# End-to-End Testing System

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive end-to-end testing system for the social proof notification microservices. The system tests the complete flow from site creation to notification delivery.

## 🎉 Current Status: ALL TESTS PASSING ✅

As of the latest update, all core functionality is working perfectly:

- ✅ **Site Creation Service**: Creates test sites and integrations  
- ✅ **Database Storage**: File-based database with full persistence
- ✅ **Webhook Processing**: Processes Shopify webhooks and finds sites correctly
- ✅ **JSON Path Queries**: Supports `settings->shop_domain` queries
- ✅ **Method Chaining**: Multiple `.eq()` calls work perfectly
- ✅ **Redis Publishing**: Publishes notifications to Redis streams
- ⚠️ **SSE Streaming**: Endpoint exists but not fully implemented
- ⚠️ **Client Embed**: Endpoint exists but not fully implemented

## Architecture

### Microservices Tested

1. **Site Creation Service** - Creates test sites with Shopify integrations
2. **Database Storage** - File-based database for development testing
3. **Webhook Processing** - Processes Shopify order webhooks
4. **Redis Publishing** - Publishes notifications to Redis streams
5. **SSE Streaming** - Server-sent events for real-time notifications
6. **Client Embed** - JavaScript embed script for displaying notifications

### Test Flow

```
Site Creation → Database Storage → Webhook Processing → Redis Publishing → SSE Streaming → Client Display
```

## Test Scripts

### 1. Core Validation Test ⭐
```bash
npm run test:core
```
**NEW** - Comprehensive validation of all core system components with detailed reporting.

### 2. Complete E2E Test
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```
Tests the entire notification flow from site creation to webhook processing.

### 3. Fresh Flow Test
```bash
npm run test:fresh
```
Creates a fresh site and immediately tests the webhook flow.

### 4. Webhook Debug Test
```bash
npm run test:webhook
```
Comprehensive debugging of webhook lookup and processing.

### 5. Database Check
```bash
npm run test:db
```
Checks the current state of the file database.

### 6. Health Check
```bash
npm run test:health
```
Verifies server and database connectivity.

## Database System

### File Database
For development testing, the system uses a file-based database that mimics Supabase's API:

- **Location**: `data/file-db.json`
- **Tables**: `sites`, `integrations`
- **Features**: JSON path queries, method chaining, async operations

### JSON Path Queries
The file database supports Supabase-style JSON path queries:
```javascript
.eq('settings->shop_domain', 'test-store-example.myshopify.com')
```

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Mock Database Issue
**Problem**: Original implementation used a mock database that returned fake success responses but didn't persist data.

**Solution**: Implemented a real file-based database with proper persistence and JSON path query support.

### 2. Port Mismatch
**Problem**: Tests were running against port 3000 while server was on port 3007.

**Solution**: Updated all test scripts to use the correct port and added port detection.

### 3. JSON Path Query Support
**Problem**: File database didn't properly handle `settings->shop_domain` queries.

**Solution**: Implemented proper JSON path parsing and object traversal.

## Test Site Creation

### Debug Endpoint
```
POST /api/test-control-panel/test-site-debug
```
Creates test sites bypassing authentication for testing purposes.

### Site Structure
```json
{
  "id": "site_1748107863082",
  "name": "Test Site - User Name",
  "domain": "test-site-user-hash.example.com",
  "shop_domain": "test-store-user-hash.myshopify.com",
  "integration_id": "integration_1748107863083",
  "status": "verified"
}
```

## Webhook Testing

### Webhook Endpoint
```
POST /api/webhooks/shopify/orders/create
```

### Required Headers
```
Content-Type: application/json
x-shopify-shop-domain: test-store-example.myshopify.com
```

### Payload Format
```json
{
  "id": 12345,
  "customer": {
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe"
  },
  "line_items": [{
    "title": "Test Product",
    "price": "29.99"
  }],
  "total_price": "29.99",
  "currency": "USD",
  "shipping_address": {
    "city": "Test City",
    "country": "Test Country"
  }
}
```

## Debugging

### Enhanced Logging
All components include comprehensive logging:
- Database access patterns
- Query execution details
- Error conditions
- Performance metrics

### Debug Endpoints
- `/api/debug/db-check` - Database contents
- `/api/health` - System health
- `/api/test-control-panel/test-site-debug` - Site creation

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites
1. Server running on port 3007
2. Redis server running on localhost:6379
3. File database directory created

### Test Execution
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:webhook
npm run test:fresh

# Check system state
npm run test:db
npm run test:health
```

### Expected Results
- ✅ Site creation works
- ✅ Database storage works  
- ✅ Webhook processing works
- ✅ Redis publishing works
- ✅ SSE streaming works
- ✅ Client embed works

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Mismatch**: Ensure tests use correct port (3007)
2. **Database Empty**: Run site creation first
3. **Redis Connection**: Verify Redis is running
4. **File Permissions**: Check data directory is writable

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check server port
lsof -i :3007

# Verify database contents
cat data/file-db.json | jq

# Test webhook directly
curl -X POST http://localhost:3007/api/webhooks/shopify/orders/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-shopify-shop-domain: test-store-example.myshopify.com" \
  -d '{"id": 123, "customer": {"first_name": "Test"}}'
```

## Performance Requirements

- Notification delivery: < 100ms (production)
- Site creation: < 2s
- Database queries: < 50ms
- Webhook processing: < 200ms

## Future Enhancements

1. **Playwright Integration**: Full browser-based E2E tests
2. **Load Testing**: High-volume notification testing
3. **Error Simulation**: Network failure scenarios
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Automated test execution
